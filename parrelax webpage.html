       <p>
        Parallax effects involve a website’s background moving at a different speed than the foreground content. This visual technique creates an illusion of depth which leads to a faux-3D effect upon scroll. 
          <br><br>
        While parallax effects can make websites feel more interactive and engaging, <br><br>
        it’s important to note that excessive movement within parallax effects can cause harm for those with vestibular disorders. <br><br>
        The illusion of movement and depth can cause dizziness or disorientation. <br><br>

                If you use these websites as inspiration for your own, follow these guidelines for accessible parallax effect design:

                Keep the number of parallax effects to a minimum
                Constrain movement effects within a small area of the screen
                Include options for users to turn off parallax effects
                Don't let your effects distract users from important information.
