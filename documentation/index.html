          <h2>What is C++</h2>
          <p>
            C++ is a general-purpose programming language widely used nowadays
            for competitive programming. It has imperative, object-oriented, and
            generic programming features. C++ runs on various platforms like
            Windows, Linux, Unix, and Mac. C++ is an efficient and powerful
            language that finds wide use in various GUI platforms, 3D graphics,
            and real-time simulations. Because of the inclusion of rich function
            libraries, working in C++ becomes simpler and more convenient than
            C. Being an object-oriented programming language like Java, C++
            provides support for inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, etc.
            Unlike C, C++ allows exception handling and function overloading.

            The “Hello World” program is the first step towards learning any
            programming language and also one of the simplest programs you will
            learn. All you have to do is display the message “Hello World” on
            the screen. Let us now look at the program:
          </p>

          <p>
            C++ is an object-oriented programming language. <br />The main
            pillars of object-oriented programming languages are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Object and Classes</li>
            <li>Inheritance</li>
            <li>Polymorphism</li>
            <li>Abstraction</li>
            <li>Encapsulation</li>

        <section class="main-section" id="object">
          <h2>Object and Classes</h2>
          <p>
            Object-oriented programming uses objects in programming. It aims to
            implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding,
            polymorphism, etc. The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data
            and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the
            code can access this data except that function.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Object:</strong> An Object is an identifiable entity with
            some characteristics and behavior. An Object is an instance of a
            Class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated, but when it
            is instantiated (i.e., an object is created), memory is allocated.
            <br /><strong>Class:</strong> The building block of C++ that leads
            to Object-Oriented programming is a Class. It is a user-defined data
            type that holds its own data members and member functions, which can
            be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class. A class
            is like a blueprint for an object. For example: Consider the Class
            of Cars. There may be many cars with different names and brands, but
            all of them share some common properties like having 4 wheels, a
            speed limit, and a mileage range. So here, Car is the class, and
            wheels, speed limits, and mileage are their properties.

        <section class="main-section" id="inheritance">
          <h2>Inheritance</h2>
          <p>
            The capability of a class to derive properties and characteristics
            from another class is called Inheritance. Inheritance is one of the
            most important features of Object Oriented Programming.
            <br /><strong>Sub Class:</strong> The class that inherits properties
            from another class is called a Sub class or Derived Class.
            <br /><strong>Super Class:</strong> The class whose properties are
            inherited by the subclass is called the Base Class or Super class.
            Using inheritance, we write the functions only one time instead of
            three times since we have inherited the rest of the three classes
            from the base class (Vehicle).
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Mode of Inheritance:</strong><br /><br />

            <strong>Public Mode:</strong> If we derive a subclass from a public
            base class, then the public members of the base class will become
            public in the derived class, and the protected members of the base
            class will become protected in the derived class. <br /><br />
            <strong>Protected Mode:</strong> If we derive a subclass from a
            Protected base class, then both the public member and protected
            members of the base class will become protected in the derived
            class. <br /><br />
            <strong>Private Mode:</strong> If we derive a subclass from a
            Private base class, then both the public member and protected
            members of the base class will become private in the derived class.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>Types of Inheritance in C++:</strong>
            <br /><br />
            <strong>Single Inheritance:</strong> In single inheritance, a class
            can inherit from only one class; i.e., one subclass is inherited by
            one base class only. <br /><br />
            <strong>Multiple Inheritance:</strong> This feature of C++ allows a
            class to inherit from more than one class; i.e., one subclass is
            inherited from more than one base class. <br /><br />
            <strong>Multilevel Inheritance:</strong> In this type of
            inheritance, a derived class is created from another derived class.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>Hierarchical Inheritance:</strong> In this type of
            inheritance, more than one subclass is inherited from a single base
            class; i.e., more than one derived class is created from a single
            base class. <br /><br />
            <strong>Hybrid (Virtual) Inheritance:</strong>
            Hybrid Inheritance is implemented by combining more than one type of
            inheritance, for example: combining Hierarchical inheritance and
            Multiple Inheritance.

        <section class="main-section" id="polymorphism">
          <h2>Polymorphism</h2>
          <p>
            The word polymorphism means having many forms. In simple words,
            polymorphism can be defined as the ability of a message to be
            displayed in more than one form. A real-life example of polymorphism
            is that a person can have different characteristics simultaneously.
            For example, a man can be a father, a husband, and an employee at
            the same time. Thus, the same person possesses different behaviors
            in different situations. This is called polymorphism. It is
            considered one of the important features of Object Oriented
            Programming.
            <br />
            <strong
              >In C++, polymorphism is mainly divided into two types:</strong
            >
            <br />
            1. Compile time Polymorphism<br />
            2. Runtime Polymorphism
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Compile time polymorphism:</strong> This type of
            polymorphism is achieved by function overloading or operator
            overloading. <br /><strong>Runtime polymorphism:</strong> This type
            of polymorphism is achieved by Function Overriding.

        <section class="main-section" id="abstraction">
          <h2>Abstraction</h2>
          <p>
            Data abstraction is one of the most essential and important features
            of object oriented programming in C++. Abstraction means displaying
            only essential information and hiding the details. Data abstraction
            refers to providing only essential information about the data to the
            outside world, hiding the background details or implementation.
            <br />
            Consider a real-life example of a man driving a car. The man only
            knows that pressing the accelerator will increase the speed of the
            car, or applying brakes will stop the car, but he does not know how
            pressing the accelerator actually increases the speed; he does not
            know about the inner mechanism of the car or the implementation of
            accelerator, brakes, etc. in the car. This is what abstraction is.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Abstraction using Classes:</strong> We can implement
            abstraction in C++ using classes. Classes help us group data members
            and member functions using available access specifiers. A class can
            decide which data member will be visible to the outside world and
            which will not.
            <br />
            <strong>Abstraction in Header files:</strong> Another type of
            abstraction in C++ can be found in header files. For example,
            consider the pow() method present in the math.h header file.
            Whenever we need to calculate the power of a number, we simply call
            the function pow() present in the math.h header file and pass the
            numbers as arguments without knowing the underlying algorithm
            according to which the function is actually calculating the power of
            numbers. <br /><br /><strong
              >Advantages of Data Abstraction:</strong
            >
            <br />
            1. Helps the user avoid writing low-level code.<br />
            2. Avoids code duplication and increases reusability.<br />
            3. Allows changes to internal implementation of a class
            independently without affecting the user.<br />
            4. Increases the security of an application or program as only
            important details are provided to the user.

        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="encapsulation">
          <h2>Encapsulation</h2>
          <p>
            In normal terms, encapsulation is defined as wrapping up data and
            information under a single unit. In Object Oriented Programming,
            encapsulation is defined as binding together the data and the
            functions that manipulate them. Consider a real-life example: in a
            company, there are different sections like the accounts section,
            finance section, sales section, etc. The finance section handles all
            financial transactions and keeps records of all the data related to
            finance. Similarly, the sales section handles all the sales-related
            activities and keeps records of all sales. Now there may arise a
            situation when an official from the finance section needs all the
            data about sales in a particular month. In this case, he is not
            allowed to directly access the data of the sales section. He will
            first have to contact another officer in the sales section and then
            request him to provide the particular data. This is what
            encapsulation is. Here the data of the sales section and the
            employees that can manipulate them are wrapped under a single name
            “sales section.”
          </p>

          <p>
            Encapsulation also leads to data abstraction or hiding. Using
            encapsulation also hides the data. In the above example, the data of
            any section like sales, finance, or accounts is hidden from any
            other section.<br />
            In C++, encapsulation can be implemented using Classes and access
            modifiers.
