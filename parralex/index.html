          Parallax effects involve a website’s background moving at a different
          speed than the foreground content. This visual technique creates an
          illusion of depth which leads to a faux-3D effect upon scroll.
          <br /><br />
          While parallax effects can make websites feel more interactive and
          engaging, it’s important to note that excessive movement within
          parallax effects can cause harm for those with vestibular disorders.
          <br /><br />
          The illusion of movement and depth can cause dizziness or
          disorientation.

          If you use these websites as inspiration for your own, follow these
          guidelines for accessible parallax effect design:
          <br /><br />
          - Keep the number of parallax effects to a minimum
          <br /><br />
          - Constrain movement effects within a small area of the screen
          <br /><br />
          - Include options for users to turn off parallax effects
          <br /><br />
          - Don't let your effects distract users from important information.
          <br /><br />
